### Group: 4

## Overview
The aim of this project is to evaluate various algorithms in one of the most famous and import NP-hard problem within Computer Science - the Bin Packing Problem. 
>[!NOTE]
>Several algorithms will be implemented and tested following this project - among them include:
>```
>1. Greedy Algorithms (First Fit / Best Fit / Next Fit)
>2. Decreasing Algorithms (First Fit Decreasing / Best Fit Decreasing)
>3. Heuristic Algorithms / Particle Swarm Optimization
>4. Metaheuristic Algorithms / Genetic Algorithms
>```


## Compilation Instructions
### How to run

1. Download and install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers from [eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/).

2. Ensure that you have the JDK installed and properly configured on your system.
