# The Bin Packing Problem


## Overview
### The aim of this project is to evaluate various algorithms in one of the most famous and import NP-hard problem within Computer Science - The Bin Packing Problem. 

This optimisation problem consists of assigning N items of different sizes into the smallest number of bins each with capacity, 
c (Wolpert, et al., 2013). Several algorithms will be implemented and tested following this project - among them include:

1. Greedy Algorithms (First Fit / Best Fit / Next Fit)
2. Decreasing Algorithms (First Fit Decreasing / Best Fit Decreasing)
3. Heuristic Algorithms / Particle Swarm Optimization
4. Metaheuristic Algorithms / Genetic Algorithms


## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Java programming language.


## Setup
1. **Install Eclipse IDE**: Download and install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers from [eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/).
2. **Install JDK:**  Ensure that you have the JDK installed and properly configured on your system.
3. **Clone the Repository:**  Clone or download the project repository from this [link](https://github.com/dalodeju/AIM-Group-4.git).


## Program Execution
1. Navigate to the project directory.
