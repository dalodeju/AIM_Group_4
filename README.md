## Compilation Instructions
### How to run

1. Download and install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers from [eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/).

2. Ensure that you have [JRE 17.0.1](https://download.eclipse.org/justj/jres/17/updates/release/17.0.1/index.html) installed.

3. Install Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Skip this step if already installed.

4. Clone or download the project repository from this [link](https://github.com/dalodeju/AIM-Group-4.git).
```
git clone https://github.com/dalodeju/COMP2042_CW_efydl.git
```
